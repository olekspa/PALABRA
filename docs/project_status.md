# Palabra v7.0 — Project Status

## Active Focus
- Implement Time Extend offer flow during timeout and link powerup consumption back to inventory.
- Build out powerup management screens (earn, purchase, and inventory visibility).
- Expand widget/state test coverage for the run controller, timer, and deck builder.

## Recently Completed
- Gate → Pre-run → Run flow with device/course gating, row blaster toggle, and interactive board UI.
- Pause overlays for tier breaks and finish summary screen pulling from the latest run log.
- Repository scaffolding, Isar models, deck-building logic, and vocabulary seeding pipeline with tests.

## Backlog & Risks
- Audio/animation polish and tactile feedback remain undefined.
- Real LMS course detection still stubbed on the gate screen.
- Content validation tooling covers vocabulary only; need similar guardrails for powerups/config.
